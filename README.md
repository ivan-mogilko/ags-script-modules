# ags-script-modules

This is my personal collection of AGS Script modules and Demo games for them.<br>
Most of these are posted with further instructions on [official AGS forums](https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/forums/index.php?board=10.0).
Recently I started writing better docs in this repository's wiki, but only few modules are documented at this point:
https://github.com/ivan-mogilko/ags-script-modules/wiki

The modules are arranged in subdirs roughly by their kind.<br>
There's a special "_dump" dir where I store random scripts; these are either not good for a real module or something I just did not have time to tidy up yet.

All scripts are free to use and released under [MIT License](LICENSE.md).
