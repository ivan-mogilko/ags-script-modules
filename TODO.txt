Following are old notes copied over from an older local branch...
These require re-investigation, as some may be obsolete, or not clear today.

DD:
+ Dont create representation DDCommon until started to drag
+ if (!DragDrop.Enabled) -- need to test if reset if necessary, in case was disabled during drag
+ DragDropCommonMode -- need NONE?
[DONE]+ eDDCmnMoveGhostOverlay ---- for 3.6.0 allow for GUIs and InvItems!
+ correct property/function description comments -- hooked vs dragged etc
? consider merge DragMove + ModeEnabled? have different dragmoves per object type??? or no???
+ DragDropCommon.TryHookDraggableObject --- work regardless of MODES
+ DragDropCommon.Hook * functions --- work regardless of STATE
+ Methods to override drag start conditions (DragMinDistance, DragMinTime), a function StartDrag perhaps
+ !!!! DragDrop: allow to simulate mouse position too? as in - have abstract cursor position !!!!

DragDropCommon extra:
+ expand the settings to allow more easier setup without direct use of DragDrop
++ enable only in DragDropCommon? instead of DragDrop.Enabled.
++ define events in DDCommon too? Will that be convenient?
++ define the active drag and drop area(s)? a drop area for a particular object?
